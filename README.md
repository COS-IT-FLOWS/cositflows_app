# COS-IT-FLOWS_app
The COS-IT-FLOWS web application for an impact based flood forecasting system we are building for the Periyar and Chalakudy River Basins, Kerala, India. The application utilizes a React.JS frontend and a Django backend. We are currently aiming to utilise Timescale DB for the time-series data, with PostGIS for the geospatial data.
